// Array
// Because of its simple structure,
// it is often used in coding tests.
// Used when accessing data frequently

// List
// There is no index,
// so access must be sequentially => Slow
// Operation speed for data insertion or deletion is fast.
// Suitable for handling variable size data
// Needs a pointer,
// so the structure is more complex than an array.
// Rarely used in coding tests.
// Java supports the ArrayList class.
// It is not asked at the corporate coding test level
